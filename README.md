#Import Statements
Logging, Random, String, Pyperclip: These libraries are imported to handle logging errors, generate random passwords, manipulate strings, and copy credentials to the clipboard.

PyQt6 Widgets: These are imported to create the graphical user interface (GUI) components such as labels, text fields, buttons, layouts, spin boxes, and message boxes.

ConfigParser: Used to read and write configuration files in INI format (users.ini).

Sys: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.

##CredentialManager Configuration and Initialization
Logging Configuration: Sets up logging to record errors and messages to a file (password_generator.log).

CONFIG_FILE: Defines the filename (users.ini) for storing user credentials.

##CredentialManager Class: Manages operations related to user credentials, including generation of passwords and usernames, evaluation of password strength, saving credentials to users.ini, validating user logins, and displaying message dialogs for user interaction.

##PasswordStrengthWidget Class
Purpose: Displays password strength visually using colored bars (QLabel widgets) and a text label (QLabel) to indicate strength level.
MainApp Class (GUI)
Purpose: Represents the main application window (QWidget) that houses all graphical elements and user interaction components.

Initialization: Sets up the main application window with title, size, and layout (QVBoxLayout) to organize various widgets vertically.

Components: Includes widgets such as labels (QLabel), input fields (QLineEdit), spin boxes (QSpinBox), buttons (QPushButton), and message dialogs (QMessageBox) for user interaction.

Methods: Implements functionality for generating passwords and usernames, evaluating password strength, saving credentials, validating logins, and handling copying of credentials to the clipboard.

##Main Execution Block (if __name__ == '__main__')
Purpose: Serves as the entry point for the application, initializing the Qt application (QApplication), creating an instance of MainApp, displaying the main window, and starting the event loop (app.exec()) to handle user interactions and events.
